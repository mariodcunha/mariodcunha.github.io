		<p class="subheader-p">When I started making graphic designs for tees and merchandise, I was looking out for some branding which also reflected my thought process and me. Since the initials of my name Mario Arnold Dcunha is M.A.D, I thought I would incorporate the same. This logo is a fresh drawing just off my iPad using the apple pencil, and the red and black colours simply inspired the look, that would go well on the back collar label of t-shirts in general.</p>
		<p class="subheader-p">I tried to make the letters pin straight so that I could better show a pure neon effect for the font, but then, I decided to go back to my raw sketch of these letters so that the logo reflected my original handwriting. After all, it’s MadeByMAD.​​​​​​​</p>

		    			<p>Evolution of Music</p><p>This is my tribute to some of my favourite music legends - The Beatles, Elvis, Michael Jackson, Lady Gaga and Adele. With the 'Black and White' theme, I brought the Piano, the Abbey Road crossing, and the 'evolution' of all this together, in literal and figurative sense.</p>

		    			<p>Dial Indian for Hunger</p><p>A traditional Indian meal is eaten in a “Thali” - a range of curries placed in small bowls around the large steel plate. Normally in India, we never easily get traditional food home delivered and packed so well, as compared to fast food or other non-traditional Indian food as well. Hence this idea emerged from that thought.</p>

		    			<p>I'm Toast!</p><p>This was one of my attempts at a quick sketch on my iPad with the Apple Pencil, and then moved it to Photoshop for the finish. I wanted to keep it fresh, raw and simple. I wanted to make a few ‘pun’ designs as inspired by the ‘Food’ and ‘Pun’ design contests that were carried out on Threadless.com.</p>
