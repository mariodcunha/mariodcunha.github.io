        'Thirty Talk' is a dirty talk for prototyping. Haha! That's right. The aim was to make 30 prototypes, in 30 days, under 30 min each. The underlying goal however, was to generate a habit of prototyping. Make something, something useful, something to try, something from imagination, something stupid and fun, something that will assist work at office or work for school, or simply doodle design thinking. <br>This was inpired by James Helms, VP of Design at Intuit, and guided by Nikhil Dev, Senior Experience Designer.
        <br><br>
        Honestly, I took this as fun, and I was interested in it, but not so seirously. However, what started as a casual excercise, started getting in my veins. I wanted to make something of it. I wanted to display what I made, generate a few conversations, get talking about prototyping.
